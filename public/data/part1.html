<h4>1856-1935: Harry Clifton “Curley” Byrd and Princess Anne Academy</h4>

It was October 1859 when the first class of the Maryland Agricultural College — what is known today as the University of Maryland — stepped foot on the campus’ grounds. They were all white men, the soles of their shoes stomped on what had been a slave plantation one year prior. It would take more than 90 years for the university to enroll its first Black student.

At least four of the 34 students were sons of slave owners, including university founder Charles Calvert, who sold part of the Rossburg Farm in 1858 to act as the site of the college. At least 15 others of the first 24 university trustees enslaved Black people, according to The 1856 Project, a project produced by this university’s libraries that analyzes institutional ties to slavery. 

Black students would not be admitted to campus grounds until almost a century after the university’s founding in 1856. Decades prior to landmark case <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>, which ended the constitutionality of racial segregation in primary and secondary public education systems, Black applicants and civil rights leaders were already fighting against racial barriers at public higher education institutions — flames that were sparking a much larger fire of the Civil Rights Movement.  

Throughout his years in university administration, segregationist and university President Harry Clifton “Curley” Byrd pushed for segregated public education spheres. He believed the education Black students received in such separate programs were equal. He advocated for investing in facilities and programs at the Princess Anne Academy, founded in 1886 for freed Black people. 

The academy, known today as the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, later became a branch of Morgan College in 1890 — a private institution at the time. After the Second Morrill Act, which required states to either demonstrate that race did not play a factor in admissions or to designate a separate land-grant institution for Black people, the state of Maryland began funding Princess Anne Academy.

“If we don’t do something about Princess Anne we’re going to have to educate them at College Park,” Byrd said in 1935, the year he became university president. “Where our girls are.”

The state went on to purchase the academy in 1935, placing the institution under the jurisdiction of this university.

<h4>1935-1947: The <i>“Murray v. Pearson”</i> case and Byrd’s stance on integration</h4>

The first Black student to attend a public higher education institution in Maryland was Donald Murray, who applied to the University of Maryland School of Law in January 1935, but was rejected due to his race. 

Murray appealed to the Board of Regents, but found no success. Months later the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, a historically Black organization active in cases regarding civil rights and liberties, took the case to the court.

Thurgood Marshall, one of the lawyers representing Murray, argued segregation based on race was unconstitutional. He said the university refusing to admit Murray violated the “separate but equal” doctrine, as there were no comparable law schools for Black people in the state.

The Maryland Court of Appeals did not outlaw segregation. But the court did rule that the state had to provide “equal treatment” to Black students. 

Following <i>Murray v. Pearson</i>, Black students were able to attend separate programs to be held outside of campus, usually in high schools in Baltimore or sites in Bowie. Years later, Marshall went on to argue in Brown v. Board of Education and became the first Black justice in the U.S. Supreme Court.

At a legislative meeting in July 1947, Byrd presented reasons to not integrate the university. 

Byrd said no state in the South would be able to offer equal opportunities to Black students while the institution “acts in perfect conformity with the law.” 

Equal status in universities for Black students would mean not only attending the same classroom as white students, but also having an equal social life as well, Byrd said. That meant engaging in fraternity life, athletics, extracurriculars, all what Byrd called “a necessary part of student’s development and which provide students with many of their greatest satisfactions in life.”

“No people realize this more than the Negroes themselves for that reason, in my opinion, they prefer to have educational provisions made for them in separate institutions where they may have all of the advantages offered by complete participation in such activities as those mentioned,” he said.  

<h4>1948-1952: The NAACP and Black applicants</h4>

In 1948, teachers Rose Shockley Wiseman, Myrtle Holmes Wake and John Francis Davis, were the first Black students at the University of Maryland who completed their coursework outside of the campus. They were part of the college of education graduate studies program, but College Park professors would travel to Maryland State Teachers College at Bowie to teach. 

These students would later become the first Black students to receive their diplomas at a commencement ceremony on campus in 1951.

Other Black students who applied to this university were instead offered scholarships to attend out-of-state institutions.  Marshall and Murray challenged this in 1949.

The two lawyers along with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People recruited three students to sue the university: Parren J. Mitchell, who wanted to pursue a graduate degree in sociology; Hiram Whittle, who wanted to pursue a bachelor’s degree in engineering; and Esther McCready, who had applied to the Baltimore nursing program. All of them had been offered scholarships to out-of-state schools.

After Mitchell’s complaint was filed against this university, Byrd issued a telegram to the board. He agreed the university would admit Mitchell, but he was to take classes in Baltimore, “where equal facilities and quality of work can and will be provided.” 

But in October 1950, the Baltimore City Court ordered the University of Maryland to admit Mitchell and McCready. 

After the university admitted Mitchell, the board called for a special session on Whittle’s case, to make a decision without the court’s intervention. The university ultimately did accept Whittle — but the board also sent a letter to the Maryland legislature, saying they were forced to make the decision.

The board argued a “bi-racial system of education” — what they called a racial segregation  schooling — was proving to be impossible due to the lack of equal quality of facilities and schooling for Black people. They also noted the board made “repeated requests” over the years to provide adequate funding for universities such as Princess Anne Academy. 

“If these funds had been granted, this action of the Board today would not have been necessary,” the board said.

Whittle enrolled at this university, but did not complete his studies, leaving after one year. As for Mitchell, he graduated with a masters in sociology in 1952. In 1970, he became the first Black person elected to represent Maryland in Congress, representing the seventh district — the first Black-majority district in the state, which today encompasses parts of Baltimore and Howard counties as well as the city of Baltimore.  

In 2015, the university went on to name the sociology building after Mitchell  and in 2020, the university announced it would be naming a new dorm after Whittle in addition to Elaine Johnson Coates, the first Black woman to graduate from this university with an undergraduate degree.

Mitchell recounted his time as the first Black graduate student at this university in an interview with Outlook in 1994, a university faculty and staff weekly newspaper:

“I took the bus to College Park and walked up that long, long hill. No one smiled at me. No one talked to me,” he said.

Byrd, he said, was a “notorious segregationist,” who was “worse than the most rabid segregationist in the deep south.” 

In the summer of 1953, Byrd announced he would be resigning to run for governor against Theodore McKeldin. After officially leaving the university, Byrd would endorse the “separate but equal” doctrine throughout his campaign as the Democratic candidate.  

Byrd lost, securing 45.54 percent of the votes against McKeldin. 

<h4>1954-1965: After <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i></h4>

The Board of Regents named Wilson H. Elkins the new university president on May 4 1954, less than two weeks before the landmark case of <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>. While the board did not have the legal grounds to ignore <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>, they opened the campus only to Black Maryland residents.

Elkins did not think Black student enrollment would immediately increase, he told The Diamondback in September of that year, adding that “both the social factor and economical factor” would delay any changes in the student body. At the time, the university had only seen seven Black applicants: three who had been accepted, one rejected and the others still pending. 

Assimilation, Elkins told The Diamondback, would be “very easy this year.” 

The number did remain low. In a contribution to “Higher Education and the Civil Rights Movement,” a collection of essays on white supremacy and segregation at Southern college campuses, alum Hayward “Woody” Farrar wrote that desegregation “came slowly and grudgingly” to this university. 

In the fall of that year, seven Black students enrolled at the university, including Elaine Johnson Coates. From Baltimore, she was the only one among them to graduate, and the first Black woman to do so. The other six dropped out before the end of their first semester. 

One of them was Johnson Coates’ roommate.  

“She said, ‘I’m not taking this,’” Johnson Coates disclosed in an interview with university archivist Lae’l Hughes Watkins in 2019. 

Johnson Coates was called names, like “Aunt Jemima,” a racist caricature of Black women and racial slurs. She was told to go home. “It was very lonely,” she said. 

“But no one knew,” Johnson Coates told Hughes Watkins. “Always made it a point to go to the front of the classroom, because I wanted to be up front. And I was ignored, and looked at, and ridiculed, but I had to do it.” 

For the next decade, the university would go through glacial change. Darryl Hill, from Washington, D.C., enrolled in 1962 to play for the football team, the first Black player at this university and any Southern conference. In December 1965, alum Billy Jones became the first Black basketball player in the Atlantic Conference.

But while these trailblazers were skidding through racial barriers, the university was still overwhelmingly white in 1966. Black students made up about one percent of a student body of 28,000, and Black faculty and staff were virtually nonexistent. 

Black student activists would push — and ultimately conquer — for change. The movement began with Congress of Racial Equality, led in part by alum Earl Wynn, Andrew Chisholm, Bobby Blandford and Bob McLeod, who sought racial desegregation at this university and its surrounding communities.

“[They] all helped create the foundation for the progress that came later,” wrote Farrar, who would later become a president of the university’s Black Student Union.

<h4>1966-1978: Student activism and desegregation plans</h4>

Farrar, at the time a member of CORE, attributed fall 1967 as “the beginning of the end of the University of Maryland’s racial apathy.” As Civil Rights and Black Power movements spurred throughout the nation, Black students at this university organized not only for social action, but also to create a sense of community. 

CORE created academic tutoring programs and brought Black scholars, such as sociologist and Black Power figure Nathan Hare, to speak on campus about the latest news in the ongoing Black movement. 

The organization also sponsored social gatherings, such as dances and parties. Greek life was hostile toward Black students, not accepting Black pledges in fraternities or sororities. One house — Kappa Alpha — decorated its porch with a Confederate flag.

Given an unwelcoming campus environment and an indifferent administration, the university fostered a reputation as a racially segregated institution that reminisced the pre-<i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> decision. As a result, many college-bound Black high school graduates from Baltimore and the Washington, D.C., area would not consider this university and instead, chose to attend historically Black colleges.

The assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in April 1968 touched and angered Black students at this university. They wanted to make themselves known — a social presence impossible to ignore. The leaders of CORE decided to take such action two weeks later, during a convocation speech President Elkins gave every spring semester.

Elkins was delivering his remarks when a group of Black student leaders barged into Cole Field House. CORE member McLeod, who would later become the first president of the university’s Black Student Union, read with other students 10 demands the organization had to this university.

State troopers stopped the students before they could finish. But students demanded the establishment of a Black studies program, more recruitment efforts for Black students, the hiring of Black faculty and staff and that campus police treat Black students in a “more courteous” manner.

After the protest, interest in joining CORE’s efforts increased among Black students. In May 1968, CORE members voted, changed the organization’s name to the Black Student Union and stopped promoting white students' participation, according to Farrar. 

The following academic year was when the Black Student Union established itself as a pillar on the campus. The number of working members were relatively modest, with about 15 to 20 Black students working in various aspects of activism. But official membership numbers were kept hidden.  

“Vital to the success of the organization was promoting the idea that the group had the fanatical support of all the Black students at College Park,” Farrar wrote.

Black Student Union leaders did not give interviews with The Diamondback, nor did they allow reporters into their meetings. 

There was a steering committee with dorm and commuter representatives in addition to people in charge of publicity, treasury, social activities and academic as well as political education.

The secrecy, Farrar argues, made the administration and campus community view the Black Student Union with more power than the organization had, which played in its favor. The organization also received support from Black faculty and staff at the university. Although the numbers were small, they gave themselves to the students’ efforts and contributed greatly in the change that took place throughout decades.

In March 1969, the Office of Civil Rights in the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare charged the university system for its racially segregated campuses, calling it a violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

The student body in College Park was 98 percent white. With the federal government watching over the university, Black student leaders had a window of opportunity to challenge the administration.

Farrar, the Black Student Union’s president at the time, joined a group of Student Government Association members to meet with the Board of Regents. Farrar hadn’t planned to go to Baltimore — it was a decision made in the spur of the moment, he had written, partially because he didn’t feel like going to class that day. 

He stood in front of the board, characterizing the Black student movement at this university as peaceful, avoiding violence seen at other public universities in the nation. But that could and would change if the board did not begin desegregation efforts. 

“The time has come today for the board to do what they should have done in 1954 and completely desegregate the school,” he said, under flashes of lights and surrounded by local reporters. The board was cordial, but defensive. 

<img class="vertical" src="https://dbknews-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/unequal.dbknews.com/embeds/part1-walkout.jpg" />

<photocap>(The Diamondback)</photocap>

As Elkins’ annual spring convocation speech drew close, Black Student Union leaders drafted a series of statements they wanted the university president to read, which would have him support progressive racial policies on the record. The efforts included the creation of a Black studies program and desegregation of the university.

When Black student leaders received an advanced copy of Elkins’ official speech, thanks to SGA members, they realized the university president had rejected their statements.

In the spring, as Elkins reached the section of his speech that addressed race, about 200 students stood up and left Cole Field House. They didn’t say a word, letting their silence sit in.  

That was one of the great moments at the university during that time, Kene Holliday, who was a student at the university then, said. Holliday, who was the first Black student to have a lead role in a university production, was one of the students who walked out.

“I was so proud of my brothers and sisters,” he said. They had been told they could get in trouble or even face suspension. “And we didn’t give a damn.”

After the walkout, Farrar invited Elkins to attend a Black Student Union meeting, which the university president accepted. 

The promise of Elkins’ attendance garnered a large crowd, including Black student organizations from the University of Maryland Baltimore County and Maryland State College. Gathering in a campus auditorium, some of the students grilled Elkins on his policies regarding race. But largely, Farrar wrote, “the atmosphere was cordial.” Elkins agreed to discuss a Black studies program and an affirmative action plan, establishing two committees.

The committee in charge of a Black studies proposal, made up by history and English department chairs, faculty and Farrar, developed a solid base for the program to expand. There would be an office space, with staff and a budget, and a committee with a director, faculty and students. As part of the program’s activities, it would sponsor conferences and symposiums. It would offer courses on African American history, literature and folklore as well as the sociology of race relations. It would also implement scholarships and fellowships for students. 

The affirmative action plan was in response to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare’s charge. It called for an increase in Black student enrollment, particularly from predominantly Black neighborhoods in Baltimore and Washington, D.C., and the hiring of Black faculty and staff. It also called for financial aid to “minority students,” the creation of a cultural studies center on “the academic and social needs of minority students,” more counseling and academic support in addition to establishing more Black studies courses, according to Farrar.

Both proposals were approved in May, and the program, dubbed Afro-American studies, would start operations by the fall of 1969. Mary Frances Berry, who later became the provost of the College of Behavioral and Social Sciences, was the first director of the program.

By 1970, Black Student Union was a financially secure organization, with a budget that allowed tutoring services, a newsletter, speaker events and sponsoring of concerts and dances. Black student enrollment increased by about 79 percent since fall 1969, with 1,285 Black undergraduate and graduate students.

Farrar attributed one reason to Black student leaders’ accomplishments during those years: The willingness from both the administration and Black student leaders to sit and negotiate. Looking back, Farrar noted Elkins was “far more progressive than he seemed at the time,” as he at least did not interfere with administrators who wanted “progressive racial change” at the university.

The Department of Health, Education and Welfare’s charge against this university for its racial segregation practices was followed by years of litigation. In 1970, the NAACP’s legal fund sued the department for “for failing to enforce college desegregation” in several states, including Maryland. 

And the existing university’s efforts toward a desegregation policy had a lukewarm response from Black faculty and staff. In 1971, Black Faculty and Staff Association chairman Gareth Murray wrote to Charles Bishop, this university’s chancellor, saying the university did not show significant commitment to the Intensive Educational Development program. The program, which was a significant part of the desegregation plan, provided tutoring services and enhancement classes to first generation and low-income students. 

In Murray’s letter, he said it seemed the university was implementing the program solely to comply with federal guidelines. 

“At this point, there has been no statement of University policy setting forth directly the institutional commitment to the program,” he wrote. 

The state passed the plan for desegregation in higher education in 1974, which would increase Black student enrollment and implement programs that would increase Black student retention rate. In 1976, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare’s Office of Civil Rights began steps to cut off $65 million in federal funds for not fulfilling desegregation efforts, but a district court blocked the action.

In 1977, a federal appeals court ordered a “speedup of college desegregation in Maryland,” which meant the state would have to propose another desegregation plan. Sheldon H. Knorr, the state commissioner of higher education at the time, told The Washington Post the state had been “successful in some areas, but less so in others.”

The percentage of Black student enrollment in public institutions increased from 11 percent to 22 percent between 1970 and 1977. But most of these students were enrolled at historically Black colleges and universities. Black students made up eight percent of the College Park campus. 

The state would submit another desegregation plan in 1980, which was rejected, before receiving federal approval in 1985. 

This university took steps toward desegregation and some of the demands Black students brought to the administration. Nyumburu Cultural Center opened its doors in 1971, as a place for Black community building and appreciation for African American culture. In 1972, the student affairs program established the Office of Minority Affairs, now the Office of Multi-ethnic Student Education, tasked in running programs that aid Black students and other people of color, including the Intensive Educational Development program. In 1978, the university created the Benjamin Banneker scholarship, a merit-based financial aid for Black students.  

<h4>1981-1989: The first Black chancellor</h4>

In 1981, the year before John Brooks Slaughter arrived at the University of Maryland as the school's first Black chancellor, Black people made up 7.6 percent of the student body. Slaughter was convinced the university could increase Black presence on campus. 

“I think the university became much more welcoming to minority students, simply because they knew that it was an important goal,” Slaughter, who was this university’s chancellor from 1982 to 1988, told The Diamondback.

The office of the chancellor was created in 1970 due to a reorganization of the public universities in Maryland. The chancellor was the highest ranking administrator at this university at the time. 

The historic university data categorizes race and ethnicity as White, Black, Hispanic, American Indian, Foreign and Unknown. In 1982, 18.1 percent of students identified as non-white. By the end of Slaughter’s term in 1988, that number increased to 37.6 percent.

Black student enrollment increased from 7.6 percent in 1981 to 9.1 percent in 1989.

Following another reorganization of the University System of Maryland, William Kirwan became this university’s president in 1989.
