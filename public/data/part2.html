In the spring semester of 1986, Ed Martin spent the night on McKeldin Mall, sleeping inside of a shanty — a small, makeshift shack, usually made of wood — he had built just hours prior. 

It was a popular demonstration in the anti-apartheid movement, in which protesters called out the South African government for its racial segregation policies against Black people. An anti-apartheid coalition had existed at the University of Maryland as early as 1977, but the movement ignited in 1986 when students began to erect shanties on campus.

“​​This [was] an indication of the living conditions of the Black South Africans,” Martin, who was a vice president of the Black Student Union in 1986, told The Diamondback. “This was unacceptable.” 

The University of Maryland had invested millions of dollars in companies that had business ties with the South African government, at a time when many were calling institutions to divest and separate from the apartheid state. The movement gained nationwide momentum in the mid-80s, with wide support from university students. Students of this university, including members of the Black Student Union, called on the administration and the University System of Maryland to divest from South Africa-related businesses.

A 1986 report from the financial aid office showed the university had invested $9.1 million in 22 companies that did business with South Africa, including Johnson & Johnson, General Motors and J. P. Morgan, in July 1985. In September of the same year, the university had divested from seven companies, including Baxter Travenol Laboratories and Coca-Cola Company, lowering the investments to $7.3 million.

The report did not say why the university had cut funding.  

But even with the decrease in investments, some students called on the university to fully divest. Tim Shaw, BSU president at the time, said the move was in the right direction, but with little effect. 

“I can’t rest until we have full disinvestment,” Shaw told The Diamondback in 1986.

And they did not retreat. In February, less than two weeks after the report became public, about 40 students interrupted a Board of Regents meeting at Stamp Student Union carrying signs that read, “Silence is Complicity,” and “UM Will Divest.” BSU was one of the organizers of the demonstration. 

“We feel it’s our money being invested, and we should have a say in where it goes,” Martin said at the time.

The students originally built two shanties in the beginning of April and a third less than a week later. That same day, one of the shanties was pushed over, collapsing onto a student that was inside. 

University workers tore down the remaining shacks the following day under the administration’s orders, who cited security and safety concerns. 

On April 16, university chancellor John Slaughter met with students who had been organizing the demonstrations and advised them to look for alternative ways to protest.

He was willing to authorize funding for educational programs, he said, such as teach-ins, displays and forums about apartheid. 

At the time, the title of chancellor was given to the highest person with authority on a campus, whereas presidents oversaw multiple universities.
 
Later that afternoon, about 200 people gathered around a rebuilt shanty, with dozens of students chanting, “Up with the shanties, down with apartheid.”
   
As campus police officers began to approach and notify students they had to take down the shanty, several students huddled inside of the six-foot square structure, while others surrounded it with joined hands.

Eventually, 12 students were arrested for rebuilding the shanty. They left the mall escorted by nine campus police officers who charged them with disorderly conduct and disrupting a university function. The Prince George’s County state’s attorney later dropped the charges, saying it wasn’t a crime to “just simply build a shanty and refuse to take it down.”

Among these students was Martin. Despite the arrest, which was photographed and printed on the front page of this newspaper the following morning, Martin was energized. He laughed as he stared at the picture of himself escorted by campus police.

The university’s investment in companies tied to South Africa was an important issue, Martin said. It felt like the campus had been ignoring them up to that point, he said. 

“We weren't going to be ignored,” he said. “Whether it took arrest, or not, we just weren't ignored.”   

A day after the protest, the campus divestment coalition abruptly stopped its two-hour meeting after members realized there was an undercover police officer among them. They asked the officer, who said he wanted to be the police’s “eyes and ears,” to leave.

Slaughter, who before had ordered shanties to be torn down, allowed students to build a permanent shanty in 1987, and said police officers would guard the structure at night to protect from vandalism. He sent a letter to BSU, calling the shanties a necessary part of anti-apartheid demonstration. 

“[The campus] persists in and takes pride in its history of ensuring to all its members the right to express points of view,” Slaughter wrote in the letter. 

But for the rest of that year and most of 1988, the movement lost the energy it once had after most of the members of the coalition had graduated.

Shawnta Watson, a vice president of BSU in 1988, was the one to revitalize efforts. In a column for The Diamondback published in November of that year, she recalled being a part of the divestment efforts as a freshman. She felt it would be an injustice to let the coalition die.

She called students to join the divestment coalition, a group of 12 students in which she was the president. The university still had not fully divested, she wrote. 

“It is our responsibility, as citizens of a country who oppressed its [B]lack Americans in a similar way for more than 400 years, to take all measures necessary to terminate this practice,” she wrote. “The time is now and the word is action.” 

The divestment movement further escalated in February 1989, when Watson reached out to anti-apartheid groups from all campuses within the system. 

In March, about 100 students from various campuses attended a regents meeting, where divestment coalition members urged the board to fully divest. While the officials let them speak, they said they would not take questions. The officials moved on to the next item on their budget. 

One coalition member walked up to the podium, demanding to know why the officials weren’t taking questions. The meeting was adjourned to the chants of several students.

“Free South Africa,” they said.  

Two months later, in May 1989, the board decided to sever all financial ties with the South African-tied companies by Dec. 31 of that year.
