Before there was a Banneker/Key Scholarship, the most prestigious merit-based scholarship at the University of Maryland, there were two scholarships: Banneker and Key. 

The Benjamin Banneker Scholarship was established for incoming Black freshmen in 1978, as part of the university’s efforts to desegregate campus. The Francis Scott Key Scholarship came a decade later and was designed for students of all races. 

The Banneker scholarship annually selected about 45 Black incoming freshmen with high marks. But it took just 12 years for the program’s opponents to take it to court, claiming it discriminated against non-Black students. 

“There were obviously still significant issues and legitimate concerns by African American students about equity and fairness and inclusion,” William Kirwan, who presided over this university from 1988 to 1998, told The Diamondback. “But … the percent of students who were African American did begin to grow.” 

In 1990, Daniel Podberesky, a white and Hispanic student, applied for admission, but was rejected from both Key and Banneker scholarships. His test scores and GPA weren’t high enough to meet the Key’s test score and GPA requirements, but his marks would have qualified him for Banneker — except he wasn’t Black. 

In <i>Podberesky v. Kirwan</i>, Podberesky alleged that the race-based scholarship was a violation of the equal protection clause in the 14th Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits racial discrimination in any program that receives federal funds.

Daniel Podberesky did not respond to requests for comment from The Diamondback in time for publication.

Kirwan remembers his time at this university as a period of “enormous turmoil.” He came to this university in 1964 as an assistant professor in the math department. He witnessed students advocating for the Civil Rights movement and calling for equality and respect. 

During Kirwan’s time at the university, Maryland was one of the 18 southern states in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and received an order from the federal government to desegregate its public schools and institutions in 1969.

The Banneker Scholarship was part of the university’s desegregation efforts. 

The scholarship, which required an essay on race and leadership in the college application, was meant to encourage Black students to attend the institution. Kirwan said the program was successful in its prime and necessary to support Black students. 

The Banneker Scholarship awarded about $33,500 per person in 1990. The sum was enough to provide full financial support to a student for four years, according to a district court opinion. Eligible students earned a 900 on the SAT and a 3.0 GPA. 

Podberesky scored 1340 on his SAT and had an unweighted 3.56 GPA in high school. His GPA and SAT score fell below the cutoff established for consideration for the Key Scholarship. In court, Podberesky’s attorneys argued the cutoff was discriminatory, especially given the absence of Hispanic people on the scholarship selection committee. 

The university pushed back, arguing the Office of Civil Rights, under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, told them they had to create programs, such as the Banneker Scholarship, to increase diversity, Kirwan said. 

A federal district court ruled in the university’s favor in 1991, saying the program was part of the university’s efforts to “rectify past discrimination.” The court also rejected Podberesky’s claims on the Key Scholarship, deciding race had not been a factor for the rejection. 		

While the university had increased Black student enrollment and retention, the district court said the university was not “free from discrimination,” as the Podberesky team had argued.  

“The effects of longstanding discrimination are pervasive, and there is ample evidence in the record before me to support the view of UMCP officials that it is premature to find that there are no present effects of past discrimination at the institution,” the court opinion read. 

<h4>The fight continues</h4>

Podberesky appealed the case in 1993. At an appeals court hearing, the university’s lawyer, Evelyn Cannon, who was the state’s assistant attorney general, told the court the university had a history of discrimination. Segregation was still impacting the campus, Cannon argued. 

“A Black child going to college now has parents or high school counselors who remember all too well that they were unwelcome at College Park," Cannon said. "That's measured in three criteria: enrollment, retention and graduation. In each of those areas, [Black people] are underrepresented." 

At the time, the U.S. Department of Education said the state of Maryland had done “little” to integrate its institutions of higher learning up to 1985. 

The case attracted national attention. Then-President Bill Clinton’s administration urged the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case, saying the appeals court’s decision would “cause substantial confusion regarding the legal and constitutional standards applicable to scholarship programs.”

In December 1994, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, ruled with Podberesky, saying the university had not shown that “race-neutral solutions” couldn’t have helped Black student enrollment and retention or that the program was narrow enough to “overcome the usual constitutional barrier to government aid based solely on race.”  

Ultimately, the judges reversed the district court decision, Kirwan said, arguing that student enrollment data showed the university had already become more integrated. 

The only way the university could maintain the program was if they could prove the conditions that led to segregation of Black people at the university were still happening, Kirwan said. 

“This came back to us, to me as president, as a real dilemma,” Kirwan said. “Do we now try to argue that, ‘Well, things aren't perfect at the university, we still have problems.’ Or do we just say, ‘Okay, we put up the good fight and we lost, and we have to abandon the Banneker Scholarship.” 

Kirwan gave the matter a lot of thought. A lot of parents and high school counselors of students the university was hoping to recruit were never allowed to go to the university due to segregation. Implicit bias, he said, was “rampant” in the country, the state and the university.  

“There were all sorts of reasons out there why ... African American students would be influenced not to come to the University of Maryland,” he said. “So, I decided we had to go back and make that case.”  

<h4>The aftermath</h4>

When the university tried to appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court did not take on the case. The court voted in May 1995 to leave the federal appeals court ruling intact. Podberesky had graduated from this university in the spring of 1994 and was enrolled in the University of Maryland at Baltimore medical school at the time. 

“We had to abandon the Banneker Scholarship,” Kirwan said.

In December of the same year, the state paid Podberesky’s lawyers $436,000 in legal fees. Podberesky received a $32,000 settlement, about the value of the Banneker Scholarship. 

Kirwan was “upset” and “very depressed” with the case decision. He was also concerned for the future of the university. They had spent years making a case that there were still problems that needed to be addressed when it came to supporting Black students. He expected a drop in Black student enrollment. 

The number of Black merit scholar students enrolled in the freshman class of 1995 dropped from 32 to 19. But when the admissions officer went to his office in the following fall, Kirwan was “overjoyed.”

Black freshmen made up 16 percent of the class, the highest percentage in the university’s history at the time, according to The Baltimore Sun. Black student enrollment overall increased from 10.9 percent in 1994 to 11.7 percent.  

Kirwan said he did believe there was a justification for the scholarship to exist, especially considering the “enormous disadvantage” Black students have in society. Black communities have historically been subjected to slavery and segregation and targeted by legislation that prevented their equal participation in society, he said. 

Despite going through what Kirwan called a “wrong” and “emotionally charged situation,” Kirwan said the end result wasn’t necessarily bad. Though the Banneker Scholarship ended as a program for Black students, the university merged it with the Key Scholarship. He hoped to have gained some credibility with Black students at the time. 

In 1995, one of the last students to receive the Banneker Scholarship spoke on the impact the program had on her.

“The Banneker program showed me and … others that College Park really was making an effort to recruit and retain minority students,” Maisa Herron told The Baltimore Sun.

As of December 2021, Black students make up 11.1 percent of the student body.
