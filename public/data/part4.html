When Darryl Hill arrived at Clemson University’s football field in the fall of 1963, there was a turtle hanging from the goalpost by a noose, its face, hands and feet painted black. 

Hill, the first Black player in the history of University of Maryland football, believes the message was meant for him. However, he didn’t let the blatant hostility and hate affect him.

“So I went and played the game,” Hill said. “And [I] had a great game.” 

Maryland was the first school in southern conferences to recruit Black players for their football and men’s basketball teams.

Hill, who grew up in Washington, D.C., came to College Park in 1962 with a football scholarship. Ivan Taylor, who lived in Prince George’s County, was the first Black student manager for men’s basketball in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Billy Jones, who was from Baltimore, played basketball at this university from 1965 until he graduated. 

But even as the university pushed for integration, Black students and athletes were not treated equally and lived on a campus that did not welcome them.

Jones realized that as a freshman.

“We’re going to have to be tough, be thick skinned,” he said.

Hill wasn’t the first member of his family to break barriers  — his great-grandfather was the first person of color to be hired by the Washington, D.C., Fire Department, Hill said. 

Hill played football and ran track in high school, winning the Washington City Championship in football in his senior year before graduating in 1960.  The 16-year-old went to Xavier University on a football scholarship for a year before receiving an invitation to play for the Naval Academy.

Hill became the first Black man to play football for the Naval Academy on the freshman team. He played alongside Roger Staubach, a member of the NFL Hall of Fame.

In 1962, Hill officially came to College Park, where once again, he was the first Black football player on the team in 1963. Despite having a track record of breaking all of these boundaries, Hill didn’t fully grasp the impact he had and the legacy he was starting to build. 

“I was young and I was dumb, and I didn’t think much of what was going on with this integration stuff,” Hill said. “Maybe I should have.”

Despite receiving an athletic scholarship from the Terps, Hill’s arrival to the campus did not come without obstacles and opposition.  

Other universities in the Atlantic Coast Conference pushed back. Frank Howard, the then-head coach and athletic director of Clemson University, threatened to pull their team out of the ACC if Hill was given a scholarship.  

The university backed him up for the most part, Hill said, even when a lot of southern institutions were unhappy with the decision. When he entered the stadiums as a football player, he heard “unified racial cheers,” with fans yelling slurs at him. 

In the same Clemson game of 1963, Hill’s mother was also initially denied entry to the stadium, which at the time barred Black people. Hill said he had told her not to come, but she showed up anyway. 

Black people weren’t allowed in the stadium, Hill said, so they had to sit out on a dirt field that looked over the stadium at the end zone.

Eventually, Hill said she was escorted to Clemson University President Robert Edwards’ private box by Edwards himself. Hill made history in that game by breaking this university’s single-game record for receptions. 

Decades later, Hill was invited back. The same stadium that denied his mother entry due to her race invited the football player, now retired, for the 50th anniversary of the game where he showed his talents. 

That game had a profound impact on Edwards, Hill said. Hill broke down the walls of segregation on Clemson’s football field, and that sparked a desire for Edwards to do the same throughout this university.

“That Monday, he ordered every ‘white-only’ sign and every ‘colored’ sign in the bathrooms, dormitories, cafeterias, restaurants and the whole campus taken down,” Hill said.

At this university, Hill couldn’t navigate campus like his white teammates.

He was denied service at some bars and restaurants in College Park. His friends wanted to “go in and wreck the place,” but Hill didn’t see a point to it. Even as a record-breaking player, Hill said he never saw a single picture of himself in the yearbooks.

Still, Hill says the university changed the nation. 

Before, Black athletes usually played in northern conferences or historically Black colleges and universities. 

“Maryland served the nation a good duty,” Hill said. “Maryland, by signing me to a scholarship, opened the doors so that African Americans could go to any college they wanted to go to.”

<h4>Robbed of experiences</h4>

Billy Jones played point guard during his high school years, leading his basketball team to state championships. He even played on the University of Maryland’s court, years before he enrolled at the school.

Yet, when the university recruited Jones to be the first Black basketball player, they moved him away from the position he wanted, making him play small forward instead.
  
“This is the first time I’ve probably said that, and it was, what, 50 years ago,” Jones, who was also the first Black basketball player in the ACC, told The Diamondback in February 2021. “But I’ve never complained … I couldn’t set that tone.”

If he complained, he reasoned, the university might not recruit other Black athletes. As a trailblazer, he felt he carried that burden.

In his freshman year, Jones shared a room with another Black student, who also played basketball. The two of them quickly figured they had to support each other. 

The campus, Jones said, was not the friendliest, and they were always observant. As two Black men, they attracted unnecessary attention. 

The dorm itself was a pretty good environment, Jones said, as a lot of basketball players lived there. But classes, where he was often the only Black student, were intimidating. It took time for him to build a support group, usually people who lived in his dorm.

Jones didn’t get the best opportunities to have a college experience at this university. Like any other college town, students crowded bars and fraternities to drink and socialize. 

But Jones refrained from doing so in his freshman year as he didn’t feel welcomed. Most Black students, he said, ventured instead to historically Black colleges such as Howard University, to partake in college life.

This university’s Black Student Union — at the time known as the Congress of Racial Equality — was strengthening its presence when Jones was a student, he said. 

He said BSU took off after he graduated and gained “some clout and influence.” Jones worried about doing activism and the possibility it would jeopardize his scholarship — he knew he couldn’t afford to pay his way through school.

Jones tried other ways to influence. He began to go to events he didn’t usually go to and encouraged other Black students to do the same, such as going to international dances, lacrosse games and libraries, even if they were given looks.

“We were saying, ‘Why not, we’re students here, why not?’” Jones said. “We figured we need to start doing these things.”

But he could feel people were uncomfortable with his presence. There’s a difference between being invited and being left alone, he said. In many ways, Jones said he and Black students at the time were robbed of the “whole college experience.” 

The racism and discrimination were somewhat subtle, Jones said — how quickly he was served in a restaurant, whether he was able to exchange a purchase in the bookstore. 

Jones and other Black athletes dealt with their problems themselves, he said.  If something happened on the court or during practice, he didn’t go to the basketball coach or the office. They just dealt with it and stood their ground, he said.

“A radar goes off when something’s not right,” Jones said. “We were built for that.”

With time, Jones felt more acceptance. Still, he couldn’t pinpoint what the exact reason was — was he accepted as an athlete or as a Black student?

“I could never answer that question,” Jones said.

When Jones was close to graduating, he looked back on his four years in a different light. He was nominated to Omicron Delta Kappa, a national leadership honors society. He realized the campus not only had more Black students, but they were also starting to organize as a student union.

He came to this university to play basketball, he said, and as a Black athlete, he hoped he helped to make the campus more appealing for others like him.

“You don’t place a whole lot of importance, you are too busy doing it,” he said. “But you start to realize, you know, this has been quite a trip … We’ve come a long way.” 

<h4>A support system</h4>

While Jones and Hill have received recognition for paving the way for many people of color, others such as Ivan Taylor, the first Black student manager for the men’s basketball team, haven’t yet.

As a military child, Taylor grew up on the move, living in France, California and other parts of the world before settling in Prince George’s County. He came to this university in 1968 but quickly found the school alienating.

When he met his counselor for registration, he felt treated like a number. In some of his classes, no one sat near him or talked to him, he said. 

“University of Maryland in College Park was kind of a lonely place for a Black student,” Taylor said. “You didn’t feel welcome or that you belonged.”

Joining the basketball team as a student manager helped him. 

Taylor began to feel a better sense of belonging. During his sophomore year, Taylor moved into the basketball team’s dorm. He ate with the team and traveled on the road with them — they became like his brothers.

“I felt like I had a family or support system on campus,” he said. 


As a manager, he was usually the first person to arrive at the Cole Field House and the last one to leave. He prepared the gym for practice, kept statistics, participated in different drills and put together playbooks. 

But outside of basketball, Taylor felt ostracized, like the university wanted to admit Black students to fill a requirement.
 
“Then after that, they could care less about you,” he said.

He wanted to go to the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, a historically Black college. His mother was the one who insisted he go to the University of Maryland to get a better education, he said. 

“She had no idea since she had not been to college herself and didn’t know what it was like at that time,” he said. “It’s just an experience that most wouldn’t want to have.” 

But Taylor said he doesn’t completely regret coming to College Park because of the people he met through basketball.

“I saw how hard they worked at their craft of becoming the best athletes,” he said.

Taylor has looked into the criteria to join this university’s Hall of Fame. He hopes to be recognized as the basketball team’s first Black student manager.

He suggested to the athletic office they should consider recognizing support personnel. They have taken on the suggestion, and Taylor has been nominated before, he said, though he was never inducted.

“Maryland kind of led the way,” he said. “We had the first Black football player in the ACC, the first Black basketball player, the first Black coach and me, the first Black student manager.”

Years later, he was able to apply the athletic skills he observed to himself. He went on to become a professional kickboxer in Thailand after joining the U.S. Air Force. He served in the military for 20 years.

But it’s been at least a decade since he has been back to the university, he said.
	
“The only reason I would ever return [to the university] is if they ever inducted me into the Hall of Fame,” he said. “I don’t know if it’s ever going to happen.”

<h4>The legacy</h4>

When Hill, Jones and Taylor were in school, there were barriers set up for Black students and athletes, either by law, custom or tradition, Jones said. 

The Civil Rights movement was leading to some changes, even if there was opposition, but the general climate remained the same — people and institutions would not go out of their way to make Black students feel comfortable, Jones said.  

Now, a lot of these barriers have been broken.

“If you went to the University of Maryland and didn’t see Black students now … you’d be shocked,” Jones said.

Racial biases are still present, he said. But people are less inclined to act on them.

“That’s the world, that’s College Park today,” Jones said.
