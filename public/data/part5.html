Maxine Gross was raised in Lakeland, a historically Black neighborhood, just like her father before her. Her father worked at the University of Maryland for about 38 years, and he started as a mechanic’s assistant in the 1960s, despite already being a trained mechanic. Her grandfather worked in the dining hall, and was employed at this university for about 40 years. 

Gross’ father moved up into facilities management in the 1970s, and ultimately retired as an assistant director.

“Because of limited opportunities, a lot of people worked for the University of Maryland their whole working lifetimes,” Gross, the chairperson of the Lakeland Community Heritage Project said.

Black workers at the University of Maryland have a more than 150-year long history, and it started when the Maryland Agricultural College, the predecessor to this university, was chartered in 1856. Black workers have faced decades of racial discrimination, many still reporting unequal treatment to this day.

For Lakelanders, this university was where they could get consistent employment, usually as groundskeepers, housekeepers and food service workers, even if it wasn’t particularly lucrative. 

In 1966, about the time Gross’ father began working at the university, the university implemented the U.S. Department of Education's Upward Bound program to bring more Black students to the campus. The purpose of the high school-level initiative was to get more low-income Black high school students to enroll in college.

Dr. Jerry Lewis, the executive director of Academic Achievement Programs, says he is the longest serving Black staff member at the University of Maryland. He came to this campus in 1972 to manage the university’s Upward Bound program.

But even with an increased Black student population at this university in 1968, Lewis said the program wasn’t changing the on-campus environment for them. They were still dealing with racism and “horrible experiences.”

Gareth Murray was a Black undergraduate student studying psychology at this university from 1965 to 1970 and later, he became the first president of the Black Faculty and Staff Association in 1971 as a graduate student. Murray remembers seeing and experiencing racism during his early days on campus.

“There were some parents who complained back then because they found out that their child was going to be rooming with a Black student,” Murray said.  

Another time, Murray applied to be a drum major at Mighty Sound of Maryland, this university’s marching band. Standing six-foot-six with drum major experience, Murray believed he was qualified for the position. But instead, Murray said the band picked a white student who had no marching experience or experience as a drum major. He left the marching band because of this case of “blatant racism,” he said.  

Things like that made it tough for him and other Black students to continue to be involved with the university, Murray said. But Black workers in dining services and in housekeeping played “an unspoken role” in making life tolerable for Black students back when he was enrolled.

“Most of us met them in the dining hall and in the dorm, and we definitely became friends. They knew who we were,” Murray said. “They were extremely supportive.”

Lewis agreed with Murray and said Black workers were like family to Black students, giving them pep talks when things got hard.

“People in the dining hall actually became the aunts and uncles of Black students on campus because there were no Black faculty around,” Lewis said.

Kathy Griffin was a cook at this university for more than 20 years, retiring in 2018. She didn’t just view herself as an aunt to students. In fact, some students would call her “mom.”

And like any good mom, Griffin still remembers the specific meal requests students made to her even years later. One student didn’t want his grapefruit and his orange to touch, Griffin recalled. Another student’s regular order was seven eggs, some kind of vegetable, quinoa and a bowl of fruit. 

“Those were my babies. I had to make sure they were fed,” Griffin said. “On my days off, I would panic because I didn’t think anybody could do it but me.”

Griffin still remembers the day she served a student chicken noodle soup when she had a cold, back in 2000, even though the Diner wasn’t serving soup that day. Griffin made it from scratch. The next day the same student loved Griffin’s soup so much that she asked for more. 

It was the student’s first time away from home, she told Griffin, and she didn’t feel as alone anymore now that Griffin had taken care of her.

“I was like, ‘Wow, they pay attention.’ I just figured they just come in, get their food and go on about their business,” Griffin said. 

BFSA parliamentarian and Nyumburu Cultural Center associate director Anne Reese Carswell called workers like Griffin “the glue” that keeps campus running smoothly. 

“Lord knows if they took off a week. No one to pull trash. Nobody to cook the students their food,” Carswell said. “They are very important even though people look over them.”

The number of Black employees at this university did begin to increase through the years. Still, groups such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People felt as though Black people weren’t advancing like they should have been. It’s partially why Black workers on this campus formed the BFSA in 1971, said BFSA parliamentarian and Nyumburu Cultural Center associate director Anne Reese Carswell.

When Carswell was asked how things had changed for Black workers since 1981 — the year she joined BFSA — she said, “Nothing’s changed.”

“People still complain. They feel like they’re not recognized for the work that they do,” Carswell said.

According to this university’s institutional research, planning and assessment office, people of color make up the majority of staff in housekeeping, groundskeeping and dining services, many of which include Black and Latino workers. Saul Walker, the multi-trade chief at the University of Maryland’s Residential Facilities department said they simply don’t get the respect they deserve. 

“Everybody acts like they're your boss, and they don’t really try to give you the help you need for your job,” Walker said.

When Solomon Comissiong became BFSA president in 2010, he was inundated with claims of overt racism from Black and Latino workers. 

“Within the first two weeks of being in office, I had a line of housekeepers that came one day,” Comissiong said. “They were Latina and Black female housekeepers, and they … had numerous complaints and allegations.”

The housekeepers reported incidents including racial slurs and sexual abuse, Comissiong said.

This prompted the BFSA to put together a 56-page report in 2011 chronicling all the complaints made by workers at BFSA meetings at the time. One anonymous worker wrote, “Some managers don’t respect the employees or listen to them. They treat them like children.”

A statement from this university said that the BFSA report was released under former university President Wallace Loh’s tenure, and also mentioned some initiatives President Darryll Pines and Provost Jennifer King Rice are pursuing to prioritize people of color on campus.

One initiative is the FAMILE program, which was described as “an effort aimed at  recruiting and retaining more than 100 tenured and tenure-track faculty from underrepresented backgrounds over the next 10 years.”

This university also identified 25 goals implemented to work toward ending anti-Black racism, 19 of which it says it has marked as completed.

Ulric Bethel, a Dining Services cook and food manager, said respect is something that could lead to more harmony in the workplace.

“The more recognizing our superiors are, the more harmony they're inviting in these halls,” Bethel said.

Lewis, a former president of the BFSA, sees as a major difference for workers now and workers in the 1970s. 

“We have come to a point where we have a right and we know we have a right to have equitable and fair treatment,” Lewis said. “When we don't encounter it the way we think we should, we don't always know exactly how to deal with it, even though there are more resources and more ears and more policies.”
