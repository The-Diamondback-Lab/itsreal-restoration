For a night in 1969, all eyes were turned to Kene Holliday.

As he moved on the stage, playing the protagonist of <i>The Hairy Ape</i>, a theater production at the University of Maryland, he was visibly confident. He glowered and he shouted, his voice traveling with ease. A review for The Diamondback at the time described his performance as “beautiful, searing, thunderingly powerful.” 

And when Holliday, the first Black student to have a lead role in a university play, finished his last scene, he was given a standing ovation. 

“I came there as a football player,” Holliday said. “I left there as a theater star.” 

Black theater had flourished since the beginning of the 20th century, as part of the Harlem Renaissance. But after World War II and throughout the ’60s, it also became a platform for Black Power and Civil Rights movements. The theater provided a space for Black artists to tell stories about and for Black people. Holliday aspired to do that, too, in the microcosm that existed on this campus. 

He wanted the audience to see Black people, he said — to get them up from their “very comfortable chairs and their windows” and look out of his window.

Holliday didn’t only open the door to Black students at this university to take the lead role in major university productions — he encouraged people to follow him. 

<h4>From football to theater</h4>
 
Holliday was raised in Amityville, Long Island, in a predominantly Black community. He walked every day from his neighborhood to his school in the Copiague school district, which was predominantly white. He knew he had to work hard, he said, so he could compete.

That self-discipline guided Holliday through the rest of his schooling, up to when he was recruited to play for this university. A high school football star who ran fast, he wanted to go somewhere that would allow him to study whatever he wanted, while preparing him for professional football. 

Lou Saban, then the head coach for this university’s football team, had promised him exactly that in 1967. But before the fall semester started and after Holliday had already committed, the team got a notice that Saban had been hired by the Denver Broncos. Bob Ward, an All-American defensive lineman who had played for this university, would be the head coach instead. The team was disappointed, Holliday said. 

“We all came for the same reason, we came to study at the foot of the master,” Holliday said. 

Ward had a bad temper, Holliday said. Players complained of the coach’s “inhumane and brutal” methods, including threatening the loss of their athletic scholarship, according to a New York Times article in 1969. The team issued a statement declaring they would no longer play under Ward. Holliday even offered for his uncle, who was a lawyer, to represent them if needed.  

In 1967 and 1968, the football team only won twice, with 17 losses. Ward resigned in March  1969.

But football remained a negative, hostile environment for Holliday, even after the university hired a new coach. He recalled fans waving Confederate flags at games. One assistant coach for linebackers instructed Holliday not to lift the blocking dummy  he was holding for a player — a move Holliday knew immediately would injure him. 

“I had been playing football for a long time at that point,” he said. “I realized what this guy is trying to make me do is stand there and get hurt.” 

Holliday didn’t contend. He feared he would be accused of insubordination, which could cost him his scholarship. Once the player came against the dummy, full force, Holliday dislocated his shoulder, as he expected. 

That, he said, was the reason he ultimately left the football team.  He did not feel respected. Racism kept the university at a stagnation point, he said.

“They just didn’t like the fact that I was a Black kid,  I had a big ol’ Afro, and I had a big mouth,” he said.

<h4><i>The Hairy Ape</i></h4>

By 1969, Holliday had worked toward football for half of his college career, and he hadn’t selected a major yet, or figured out what he wanted to do. So, he began to take some electives in the drama department to study acting.

That spring, Roger Meersman, a professor in this university’s theater program, reached out to Holliday saying he had a project for him. 

It was <i>The Hairy Ape.</i>

Written in 1922, the main character Yank is described as a strong man who works in a stokehole, shoveling coal into the engine of a ship. This darkened his face. The characterization was, for some critics, blackface. Others said the playwright Eugene O’Neill was illuminating the socioeconomic conditions for Black people. 

<i>The Hairy Ape</i>, for some scholars, touches on the dehumanization of workers, especially due to industrialization and socioeconomic class divide. There was an “unusually large” interest in the university production, according to a 1969 Diamondback article. 

Holliday was taken aback at first, hesitant to play the protagonist of a play titled <i>The Hairy Ape</i> as a Black man, he said. He asked himself whether he trusted Meersman — and he did.

Holliday didn’t need anyone to defend him, he said. But he appreciated it when Meersman talked to students in the theater department. 

“You leave this guy alone because, number one, you might get yourself hurt,” Meersman said. “Number two, because I want him here.” 

<h4>Black talent</h4>

Holliday graduated from this university with acting, directing and production credits. In one of his projects, Holliday narrated a documentary on Black scholar and activist Booker T. Washington. He also directed a rendition of <i>A Raisin in the Sun</i>, a 1959 play by Lorraine Hansberry, the first Black woman to have a show on Broadway. 

Throughout his time, Holliday recruited Black peers to help him achieve his goal to do “revolutionary Black theater in a white facility,” he said.  

He would usually go to Stamp Student Union, where a lot of Black students hung out in the cafeteria area and played cards. He approached those students, Holliday said, and asked if they were interested in acting, directing or helping out with stage management.

“I carried my mantle of being an African American artist,” Holliday said. “I carried with high esteem, and I feared nothing and no one.”
