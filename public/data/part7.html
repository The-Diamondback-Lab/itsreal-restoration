Earl Wynn stood in the unusually empty chapel, its visitors shunned away due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Wynn walked up to the first row, kneeled and closed his eyes. He began to pray.
 
It was his first time back to the University of Maryland’s Memorial Chapel since the spring of 1968, when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was shot and killed. The chapel was closed on the day the civil rights leader died, Wynn said. He contacted the university and demanded it open it up, so he and other Black students could grieve.
 
“I just remember crying,” Wynn told The Diamondback in March of 2021. “I just remember being angry.”
 
As the president of Congress of Racial Equality — a student group named after the civil rights national organization, later becoming the Black Student Union — Wynn saw the brutal reality of a campus that was dawdling through desegregation throughout his time at this university. Black student leaders pushed back at the administration and pushed at the university to hear them.
 
They wanted the university to increase Black student enrollment. They wanted the university to hire Black faculty and recruit more Black athletes. They wanted a history course that focused on the contributions Black people had made to society. 
 
“We were trying to create an environment that we could survive,” Wynn said.
 
The legacy of these Black student activists lives on to this day — sometimes reflecting how far the university has come, sometimes revealing there’s still a long way to go.

<h4>First impressions of campus</h4>

A Baltimore native, Wynn went to an all-boys preparatory school that was relatively diverse, predominantly Black and Jewish, he said. While all of his Black friends went to historically Black colleges, Wynn decided to go to this university. 

Wynn wanted to experience college life “to the fullest,” he said. A self-proclaimed “suave, debonair guy,” he bought a new suede jacket specifically for the homecoming football game. He wanted to look well dressed and flirt with women. But when Wynn was sitting in a section at the then Byrd Stadium, someone yelled behind him, “No n------ in this section”, and poured out a whole bottle of Coke onto his jacket. The two of them got into a fight, and that was his first and last homecoming game and sports event he attended at this university. 

He tried to rush a fraternity, as many of his non-Black friends from high school were doing. They acted like they didn’t know him.

“They couldn’t believe that I wanted to be a part of their fraternity,” he said. 

In his dorm, Wynn got along with his roommate, but other residents taunted him. They gained access to his room and poured water in his bed when he went home for the weekend.

That, Wynn said, was his introduction to this university. He decided he wanted to move out of campus. Around that time, he met another Black student, who would end up working a lot with him in pushing for equality at this university as part of CORE. Wynn and Bobby Blandford became friends, and have been for almost five decades now, and got an apartment together as students.

Blandford grew up in a predominantly Black community. Some of his childhood friends went to integrated schools, where Blandford said there was constant fighting between Black and white high school students. It usually resulted in Black boys being put out of school, he said. But Blandford “made it through,” going to an all-Black school in his district just so he wouldn’t go through that. 

But campus in 1966 — the year CORE was founded — was dramatically different. Black students made up about one percent of the student body. White and Black students navigated separate circles. White students nor Black students were reaching out, Blandford said. 

As Black student presence on the campus began to grow, Blandford felt more at home. He began to build a social safety net, where he and other students organized as activists and could hang out as college students. Coming to this university was “an eye opener” for him, he said. 

“I was able to continue my intellectual growth,” he said. “But at the same time, I began to see the contradictions. I became politicized.” 

Before coming to this university, Wynn was part of the Baltimore chapter of CORE, a national organization that took a lead role on sit-ins, the Montgomery Bus boycott and the 1963 March on Washington. He went to demonstrations at coffee shops and businesses that didn’t want to serve Black people.

That was his first experience with activism, in his senior year of high school. After what happened to him at the homecoming game, Wynn became even more determined to use the skills and knowledge he had gained in Baltimore to start to activate change in College Park. 

He initially sought to join the Students for a Democratic Society, a university chapter of a national student activist organization that heavily protested against the Vietnam War. The national organization was also involved with the civil rights movement. 

Wynn said the group had a different philosophy. A part of the “New Left” wave that took over the nation in the ‘60s, the organization sprung from Karl Marx’s teachings and often was radical. Wynn wasn’t as interested in any particular system of governance, he said.

“I just wanted to be treated as an equal,” he said.

So, Wynn shifted his efforts into CORE, becoming the organization’s second president. 

<h4>From CORE to BSU</h4>

The organization actively began to put the desires, wants and needs of Black students out to the administration, Wynn said, organizing demonstrations to get the attention of the university president Wilson  Elkins.

In one of the occasions, the students took over the President’s office, Wynn said. He got up onto his desk to read his group’s manifesto, to the protest of Elkins, who threatened to call the FBI to investigate Wynn.

Those were the circumstances surrounding the renaming of CORE. Wynn worried their point wasn’t getting across. He told Blandford he thought they should rethink the organization’s name.

Militancy and frustration was “building up” among CORE members, he said. Wynn worried the group could do something that would stain the reputation of CORE as a national organization. It was time to move on and establish their own identity, Wynn said. 

It was Blandford who suggested reframing the group as the Black Student Union. The rise of the Black Power movement in the late ‘60s drove Black students to organize, the first union beginning at San Francisco State College — now San Francisco State University — in 1966. 

The two of them brought the idea to other students who were involved — at the time only about 20 people, Wynn said — and they agreed.

Black Student Union had a different reaction — it attracted more participation among Black students, Wynn said.

“It took on more life and more energy,” he said. 

The administration pushed back even further. The group did not have a proper meeting space on campus. But they made do. One time, they had a meeting on what used to be a historically Black church at Lakeland, a historically Black neighborhood in College Park. 

Later, the director of the university’s student union reached out to Wynn, telling him to let them know when BSU wanted to meet. The organization would have a space to meet, even if the administration was opposed to it. 

BSU also had the support of Arthur Adkins, a white secondary education professor and the organization’s advisor who attended nearly every meeting, usually smoking a pipe.

“There were some good people here,” Wynn said. “I don’t want to paint the picture that everything was all bad … It was the best of times, and it was the worst of times.” 

Organizing the Black communities on campus was somewhat of a difficult task.  A lot of students were commuters from Washington, D.C., and were not involved with campus life. Other Black students didn’t want to get involved with what they likely perceived as turmoil, Wynn said, and just wanted to get an education.

“That’s all I wanted to do, too,” he said. “But it was under trying circumstances.” 

Blandford said Black athletes for the most part didn’t join BSU. Some of the coaches would tell them they didn’t need to, that if anything happens to them, they should talk to someone in athletics.

Wynn said the union had a “hardcore” group of about 50 people. 

Josie Bass, whom Wynn compared to Harriet Tubman, was the fourth quill at the leadership at BSU, along with Wynn, Blandford and Bob McLeod. She had a way with words that encouraged others to speak up, especially Black women, making them feel comfortable about joining the activism. She called them to join BSU and work with Wynn, Blandford and others. 

“Let's help them because they want to help us too,” she would say. “And we could stay strong Black women.”

The Diamondback hasn’t been able to reach Bass, and most BSU members have lost touch with her.

<h4>The assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</h4>

When news broke that Dr. King had died, Blandford was working at the National Men’s Wear, a clothing store on 8th Street in the northeast region of Washington, D.C.

The entire block was burning in flames, he said. The workers of the store were taking the suits, the clothes, “just taking everything,” he said. Others were looting liquor stores. The National Guard had been called to New York Avenue.  

He remembers seeing a Black woman standing near him, a woman who reminded him of his  mother, with an opened bottle of liquor in her hands. She fell down on the ground. 

“I stood right there in that street and just cried. I was 20 years old, I cried like a baby,” he said. “Because what hit me, when that lady was drinking … I just saw the misery. I just saw the misery of my people.” 

Wynn left campus to Bladensburg Road, where there was a flower shop that sold black roses. He bought two dozen, planning on taking them to the chapel with other students. 

He wanted to lash out, he said. He wanted to evoke the kind of violence on people that was evoked upon Dr. King, he said. But that was not the way to go.

More than 50 years later, Wynn prayed in the same chapel. He had so much anger in him the last time, he said, so he wanted to make amends — people are not supposed to go to the house of God being angry, Wynn said. 

Wynn gave his blood, sweat and tears to this school, he said. Decades later, there are still things in the recesses of his mind that he can’t draw out, often in denial of what happened and what didn’t happen, he said. It was another reason why he wanted to visit the chapel.

“So I can make peace with that part of my being a part of the University of Maryland,” he said. 

The year Dr. King was killed, Wynn, by the time a senior, resigned as president to devote his time to academics. He appointed Bob McLeod, a member of BSU who had always been the guy behind the scenes despite having great leadership skills. So McLeod became the first elected president of BSU. 

<h4>BSU under McLeod</h4>

McLeod was in charge of the public relations of BSU, dealing with campus newspapers, working on their newsletter and other communications. They wrote about upcoming meetings and the issues they were going to tackle, and noted anything that happened on campus that concerned Black students.

Initially, The Diamondback did not cover the group extensively, McLeod said. But when Black student activism spread across the nation, some student reporters were more intentional in writing stories that were relevant to the organization, McLeod said. McLeod saw the reporters attending meetings, but he was rarely interviewed, he said. So he was very careful about what he said. 

This publication wrote about CORE’s possible approval on the Student Government Association budget in December 1965. There were no further articles published about the organization until October 1967, according to the university libraries database. 

There was a shift when CORE renamed itself to Black Student Union, McLeod said. It felt revolutionary, he said, more combative.

“That’s what I wanted to project, that we were going to look out for the Black students’ interest,” he told The Diamondback. 

McLeod was thick-skinned, not letting an interaction with the administration get to him. He attributes it to being raised by a mother who was always home and a strong father. But some Black students grew up under different circumstances, he said, most of them who lived in predominantly Black neighborhoods.

Black students noticed the different grades they would get from their white peers, noticeably lower even if they had the same answers. If something was missing or stolen, Black students were looked at first. Campus police were quick to disperse Black student demonstrations, but not of other groups such as Students for a Democratic Society, which nationally had a whiter membership. 

Most of the students graduated, McLeod said, they battled through it. But decades later, it still impacts them, McLeod said — a lot of former Black students don’t want to talk about their experience at the university.

There were a lot of barriers that kept Black students isolated from each other, McLeod said. They had to diffuse those obstacles and bring people together.  

“The university should do something to acknowledge … maybe what they don’t even know they caused,” he said. “We were all young people.”

<h4>The legacy</h4>

When these students began their activism, they did not think of longevity. They were the Black Student Union then, and the organization would perhaps fade away once they graduated, Wynn said.

Yet, more than five decades later, the group is still here. 

“I’m very happy with where things are now,” McLeod said. “I don't regret what we went through to get there.” 

Following a summer of protests on the killing of George Floyd, a group of Black student leaders delivered <a href="https://umddemands.dbknews.com/">a list of demands</a> to the university.

Like 50 years ago, the students called the university to increase Black student enrollment and hire more Black faculty and staff and to increase funding for Black student organizations.

“On one hand, I stick my chest out about that, not because I was a part of it, but because it was something that we did dream up,” Wynn said.

But there’s sadness, too, especially when he read about the murder of 1st Lt. Richard Collins III. Collins was a Black student from Bowie State University who was killed at a bus stop on this campus, near Montgomery Hall in 2017. Sean Urbanski, who was a student at this university, is currently serving a life sentence for the murder.

“I’m feeling like we were a failure because there’s still a Black student union — a need for a Black student union — today,” Wynn said.
