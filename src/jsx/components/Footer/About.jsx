      <h1>About the Project</h1>
      <p>The Diamondback spent two semesters looking into collections from the University Archives, court decisions, digititzed issues of this publication, university reports and federal legislation. We talked to former Black student leaders and athletes, former university presidents and Black workers.</p>
      <p>There are still parts of this university's history that didn’t make it into this project. But we hope to provide a starting place for those who want to know about the desegregation efforts at this university. We also recommend the ongoing “Black Experience” project, as part of the “Reparative Oral Histories” university libraries initiative, that is documenting Black life on this campus.</p>
      <p>We want to acknowledge Hayward “Woody” Farrar, who was the Black Student Union president in 1970. We wouldn’t have known nearly as much about the early years of the Black Student Union without his account, which we have used in our reporting.</p>
